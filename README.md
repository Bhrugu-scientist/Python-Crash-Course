# Python-Crash-Course 

> I have created this repository as a quick reference to the chapters of a book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. 

> Code from all the chapters of this book along with exercises will be uploaded in this repository which can serve as a quick revision of Python, interview prep, brushing up the python skills and what not instead of going through the whole chapters.

> I will also some fun exercises to practice to practice the chapters.

> Let's go. Chapter 2 teaches you how to talk to a girl confidently using Python.
